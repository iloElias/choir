# Dependencies
This template has some dependencies that need to be installed on your current workspace:
- **Docker**: Mainly used for local testing
- **PHP 8.1**: The current used programming language and it minimum version
- **Composer**: PHP package manager

# 1st Step: Domain name
In your local host machine add the following lines to your `/etc/hosts` file in order to find the application.
```
127.0.0.1   your.dev.api.com
```

# 2nd Step: Preparing the environment
Build your custom Docker Image running `./docker/build.sh`

# 3rd Step: Running Docker
`docker-compose up`: Standalone version
`docker-compose up -d`: Daemon version

# 4th Step: Check your browser
Open http://your.dev.api.com/ and check the headers on your devtools, and you should see this entry `ping: "pong"`.

# Studying how it works
The most important scripts are:
- `docker/nginx/Dockerfile`: that compiles the Docker Image. Here you can find the packages installed on Linux to make
  this experiment work.
- `docker/nginx/start.sh`: This is the startup script what is executed when the container is activated.
- `docker/apply-config.sh`: Just a shortcut to apply your changes on NGinx config files. You should run this shell script
  from inside your container.
- `docker/nginx/ssh.sh`: Easy way to go into your container instance using SSH. This allows you to execute tests and apply
  your configuration experiments.
- `config/nginx`: Where all NGinx config files resides and can be edited as your will.
- `config/php8`: Where all PHP FPM config files resides and can be edited as your will.
